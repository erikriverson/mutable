Description: The mutable package allows users to construct arbitrary tabular
  material and output the object into a variety of formats. LaTeX, HTML, and
  plain text output functions are included.  Users can supply their own format
  functions for these output types, and easily create their own.  For example,
  the provided LaTeX output style can be completely changed if the user specifies
  their own format.latex function. The modular design of the package allows every
  design decision to be overridden easily and consistently. The result is that
  the user is in complete control over the final markup produced, and that many
  display versions of the same table can easily be produced from the same data.
