Description: The mutable package allows users to construct objects
    representing arbitrary tabular material and output the object into a
    variety of formats. LaTeX, HTML, and plain text output functions are
    included.  Users can supply their own format functions for these
    output types, and easily create their own.  For example, the
    provided LaTeX output style can be completely changed if the user
    specifies their own muExportLatex function. The modular design of the
    package allows every markup decision to be overridden easily and
    consistently. The result is that the user is in complete control
    over the final markup produced, and that multiple versions of
    the same table can easily be produced from the same data simultaneously.
